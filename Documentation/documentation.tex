\section{Unit Test} \label{sec:unit-test}

\tab{The UnitTest library contains classes which preform automated unit tests while a project is under development.  Utilizing C++ exceptions, the UnitTest library separates its test battery into libraries tested, suites in libraries and tests in suites.  The UnitTest library iterates through instantiated libraries running every test suite in the library.}
